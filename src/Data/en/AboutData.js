UperContent: `
  Ok . . Let’s just say it . .  I’m really passionate about what I’m working on . . 
  Although I’m still a student at my college, but I had chosen my path on my own and that is the strongest proof of what I said . . 
  So what I see that I can do is simple : I’m ready to take on any task, even if I haven’t learned it before  I’ll learn it for real . . .`,

// & My Front-End Skills
{
  title: 'My Front-End Skills !! ',
  UperContent: `
  After I had learned the global perspective about the software cycle production, 
  I finally chose the web application to focus on it and give it my time. And after
  the widely learning for Backend with Node.js Express and Python 
  with DB like MongoDB and SQL, some DevOps with tools like Docker . . , AWS . . , Vercel, GitHub . . , MongoDB Atlas and so on . .  
  And when I started the frontend journey with RAW HTML & CSS, vanilla JavaScript, I found that I can be more efficient at the 
  front-end field. And after gathering the global frontend concepts with these raw tools,
  then I moved to the frameworks world and I started with Vue.js and collected some knowledge about Angular and `,

  HighlitedContent: `
  finally I chose React with TypeScript and integrated them with the performance power
  and clean development environment of Next.js . . and used Tailwind CSS . . for fast/clean styling. 
  And Framer Motion & GSAP for animation and Three.js for 3D handling, and REST & GraphQL APIs with Apollo Server and some 
  performance techniques like lazy loading, WebKit code separation, and so on . . . 
  and of course React libraries like React Query for clean APIs and Redux/Context API for state management and more and more . .`,

  DownContent: `
  . . However, all of these technologies are just tools,
  But the most important thing that I had gained in my learning journey is the software engineer
  mindset and the ability to learn fast and adapt to any new technology or framework that I serve our project . .`,

// & Side Skills !

title: 'Side Skills ! . . ',
UperContent: `
  And with my frontend skills, I could gather some side skills to enhance my overall development capabilities and be more efficient at my work . . 
  `,
HighlitedContent: `
  some skills like robust fullstack development with Node.js and Express,
  Python, and even some DevOps with Docker . . , AWS . . , and CI/CD pipelines . .  
  I can build simple unit tests and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library,
  I can use AI tools like GitHub Copilot . . , Cursor (VIP coding), ChatGPT . .  , Lovable AI and so on . .
  I learned some about design patterns e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer and data structure & algorithms like Arrays, Linked Lists, Binary Search, DFS, BFS  
  Even took a short journey into mobile dev with Flutter . . ,

DownContent: `
  And yes, these skills are not mature in my mind but I took what I need to see the big picture of software and I can expand with it anytime if required`,

      Actually, I’ve built real projects like . . 
      an application that collects some of my skills ( microservices ) . . 
      my Portfolio site ( this one ) . . 
      some front-end layouts using CSS and little JS to just show my responsive layout skills . . 
      E-Commerce App ( almost 95% done, you can check it out on my site ) . . .`,

      Still a student, still learning, but I’ve already done more than just follow tutorials . . 
      But my self-learning manner tells you that I can do it . . My manner was that I mixed between theoretical
      knowledge with practical knowledge so you can observe that in my projects that I have built when I was learning . .`,

I’m diving deeper into the new age of programming . . I’m diving deeper into AI agents development with 
its new frameworks like LangChain , LlamaIndex , and so on . .
those tools that release the AI power from its cage and make it available for anyone, 
and giving them access to anything, literally anything . . With that magic fresh technology, I can raise my skills at building a full-stack based on AI powers . . Isn’t that cool enough?`,
